# CourseSniper

This piece of software allows students to see when any class index becomes available at Rutgers NB, either because it was dropped or positions in the class were added. Course indexes 
are inputted in the indexes.txt file, and must be added to the dictionary in sniper.py. The constants.py file should contain the email and app password of the gmail account the user
wants to use to send messages from. The phone number of the user must also be added into this file.
